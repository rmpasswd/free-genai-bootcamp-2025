    ### **Vocabulary Table**  

    | Japanese | Romaji | English |  
    |----------|--------|---------|  
    | Ë¶ã„Çã | miru | to see |

    ### **Sentence Structure**  

    1. **Did you see** + **the raven** + **this morning** + **?**  
    2. **They** + **were looking** + **at** + **our garden** + **.**  

    ---

    ### **Clues and Considerations**  

    - The verb "to see" needs to be in past tense for the first sentence.  
    - "This morning" is a time expression; think about how to say it naturally in Japanese.  
    - Japanese doesn‚Äôt use definite articles like "the," so just use the noun for "raven."  
    - "They were looking" needs a past continuous construction. Consider how to express an ongoing past action.  
    - "Our garden" shows possession, so decide how to indicate "our" properly.  
    - Japanese often omits the subject if it's clear from context.  

    Try forming the sentence! Let me know if you need more hints. üòä
